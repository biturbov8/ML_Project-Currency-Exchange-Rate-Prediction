# Exchange Rate Prediction using LSTM Neural Network

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast the USD to INR exchange rate for future dates. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly LSTM neural networks, we aim to capture and learn from the complex patterns present in the historical exchange rate data.

## Project Structure

- `usd_inr.csv`: This file contains historical data of the USD to INR exchange rate, including features such as Open, High, Low, and Close prices, as well as volume and adjusted close prices.
- `exchange_rate_prediction.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code used to train the LSTM neural network model and make predictions on the test data.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the project structure.
